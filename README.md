🚀 NeuroFleetX: AI-Powered Urban Fleet & Traffic Intelligence
👨‍🏫 Project Guide: Senthil Sir
📝 Project Overview

NeuroFleetX is an AI-driven platform designed to optimize urban fleet management and improve traffic intelligence. The system leverages real-time data, predictive analytics, and machine learning to enhance fleet operations, reduce congestion, and improve urban mobility efficiency.

❗ Problem Statement

Urban transportation systems face challenges such as:

🚦 Traffic congestion leading to delays

🚚 Inefficient fleet utilization

📉 Lack of real-time monitoring

🔧 Delayed maintenance and reporting

NeuroFleetX addresses these challenges with a smart, data-driven approach.

💡 Proposed Solution

🧠 AI-Powered Traffic Prediction using historical and real-time data

📊 Fleet Management Dashboard for monitoring operations

🔔 Vehicle Maintenance Alerts for predictive upkeep

🗺️ Booking & Allocation System for efficient routing

📈 Analytics & Reporting with visual insights

✨ Features

🔐 Role-Based Login: Admin, Driver, User

🧑‍✈️ Driver Dashboard: Route, schedule, and performance monitoring

🖥️ Admin Dashboard: Fleet overview, analytics, and reports

🛠️ Vehicle Maintenance Dashboard: Automated alerts

🤖 ML-Based Traffic & Fleet Predictions

📉 Interactive Reports: Charts and visual insights

🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
